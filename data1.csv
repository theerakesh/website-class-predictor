As a department, we believe everyone is accountable and responsible for accessibility conformance.  The accessibility field encompasses many types of technology, standards and guidelines. As a department of the federal government, we are required to abide by the Section 508 legislation. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified at section 29 USC 794d, as amended, ensures those with disabilities have equal access to government information as contained on information and communications technology (ICT), and thereby to the government employment, programs and services to which all citizens are entitled. Section 508 is only one segment of the accessibility field. As use of information technology has greatly increased within the workplace, and out, in recent years, and additional legislation has required ever-more access to government information, there is a great need for strong, effective action to ensure compliance across the department.  At the department-level accessibility actions and implementation are demonstrated through the following examples:  HHS-wide standards, policies, guidelines, and criteria for Section 508 and accessibility.  Collaboration internally, and externally, on best practices and lessons learned about Section 508 within acquisitions, training, evaluations, and other areas.  Section 508 and accessibility information and resources available on the HHS intranet and internet  Participation in the Federal Chief Information Officer Council Community of Interest (CIOC)  Bi-annual data collection for the General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Maturity Metrics  Responses to federal accessibility mandates on behalf of the department  Representation of the department at federal or interagency activities related to Section 508.  Contact the OS Accessibility Program  Feedback and inquiries regarding accessibility and Section 508 pertaining to the Department or OS can be directed to the HHS Accessibility Help Desk . Requests for training or conformance evaluation are encouraged.

Expanding beyond biomedicine into the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering disciplines, BMC now offers a wider portfolio of subject fields on a single open access platform. At BMC, research is always in progress. We are committed to continual innovation to better support the needs of our communities, ensuring the integrity of the research we publish, and championing the benefits of open research. BMC is part of Springer Nature.

We are excited about everything we have achieved in that time, especially about BMC’s leadership role in the global growth of open access. We invite you to join us, as we look at BMC’s achievements and future endeavours through interviews, videos and other resources we have created to commemorate our journey.  BMC 20th Year Anniversary Hub          Supporting the research community at this time               SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19   Springer Nature is committed to supporting the global response to emerging outbreaks by enabling fast and direct access to the latest available research, data, and resources for the research community                  Coronavirus research highlights   This collection draws together research from across BMC journals, including broad scope titles such as BMC Public Health, Virology Journal and Respiratory Research, and our more specialist journals such as Globalization and Health and Conflict and Health.

BMC Medicine 2020              Credit: Pixabay      Poor work-life balance may have negative health effects   Working adults across Europe with poor work-life balance are more likely to report poor general health. BMC Public Health 2020                      BMC Research Notes Launches Data Notes   Data is becoming increasingly more important. Researchers tell us they want to share their data to progress research, to receive more credit and visibility for their work and to comply with funder policies.  To help our authors do this, we have launched the data note.                  Open Access Funding Support Service   Did you know that there almost 250 open access article processing charge (APC) funds available to researchers worldwide? At BMC, we offer a free advice service to help our authors to discover and apply for funding. On our support pages you can find our OA checklist along with a list of research funders and institutions that make APC funding available.             Retrospectively registered trials        Pixabay      The Editors’ dilemma   Prospective clinical trial registration aims to address publication and reporting bias. Unfortunately, not all clinical trials are registered before they start. Here we discuss the dilemma faced by editors when receiving submissions reporting a clinical trial that was not registered prospectively, and a new policy for increasing transparency when a trial was registered after participant recruitment has begun.          Through the looking glass            Citizen science   In this blog, Poppy Lakeman Fraser, Senior Programme Coordinator for the Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) initiative, explains what citizen science actually is and how researchers rely on this form of data collection.

Goldberg and Others   Investigators from Israel explored the effect of two vaccine doses, three vaccine doses, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (without vaccination and before or after vaccination) on subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression to severe illness. Previous immunity-conferring events (vaccination or infection) were identified as being protective, but all protection waned with time.   May 25              Editorial  Covid-19 Update for May 24   Waning Immunity against Covid-19  E.J. Rubin, L.R. Baden, and S. Morrissey        In this audio interview conducted on May 24, the editors discuss the roles of vaccination and prior infection in providing immunity against SARS-CoV-2, as well as the gradual decline in protection over time.   May 26          Correspondence   Covid-19 Vaccine Boosters against Omicron  E.K. Accorsi and Others        Among persons vaccinated with the adenovirus-based vaccine who received a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine, protection against the omicron variant was assessed. A single booster dose of an mRNA vaccine in recipients of a single priming dose of Ad26.COV2.S provided protection close to that of a three-dose mRNA vaccine regimen.   May 25                Perspective   Medicalizing the Constitution?  M.G. Bloche   Courts and physicians need to be mindful about the use and misuse of medical-science findings in constitutional conflicts, the cloaking of moral views in scientific guise, and the marshaling of medicine’s cultural authority as a means of persuasion.   May 25       Perspective   Federal Action Supporting Overdose-Prevention Centers  A.H. Naeem, C.S. Davis, and E.A. Samuels   There is mounting interest among state and local officials in the United States in opening overdose-prevention centers, but there remains one fundamental barrier: the interpretation and enforcement of federal law.   May 21              Medicine and Society   Structural Racism in the Academic Residency Clinic  R. Vanjani, A. Pitts, and P. Aurora   Physicians’ dual loyalties to their academic institutions and to patients may not only constrain their ability to act in patients’ best interests, they may also reflect and perpetuate structural racism — a reality of which academic residency clinics provide a case study.   May 26          Perspective   When Naloxone Isn’t Enough  S. Messmer and J. Jarrett   Not all people who use drugs are interested in recovery support or medications for opioid use disorder. For patients who decline such care, the health care system does next to nothing to reduce the risk of death — but not because nothing can be done.

Braunwald              Original Research            Original Article   Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy in Resectable NSCLC  P.M. Forde and Others   Patients with non–small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to three cycles of chemotherapy with or without nivolumab, an anti–PD-1 antibody. Event-free survival was longer with nivolumab than without it (31.6 months vs. 20.8 months), and the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 24.0% and 2.2%, respectively.   May 26   Editorial Expanding Horizons for Treatment of Early-Stage Lung Cancer             Original Article   Tranexamic Acid for Noncardiac Surgery  P.J. Devereaux and Others        Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that reduces bleeding in patients undergoing cesarean section or cardiac surgery. In this randomized trial involving patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, the risk of bleeding was lower with tranexamic acid than with placebo, but noninferiority with respect to cardiovascular complications was not established.   May 26   Editorial Bleeding Outcomes after Noncardiac Surgery — Are We POISEd to Do Better?         Original Article   Activation of Oncogene Expression by Demethylating Agents  Y.-C. Liu and Others        In two small series of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, the use of demethylating-agent therapy that was aimed at inducing cell differentiation resulted in induction of expression of the SALL4 oncogene in more than 30% of patients, and such expression was associated with a poorer natural history.   May 26             Original Article   Efficacy of mRNA-1273 Vaccine in Older Children  C.B. Creech and Others        In part 1 of a phase 2–3 trial, a 50-μg dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine was safe and immunogenic. In part 2, nearly 4000 6-to-11-year-olds received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were followed for a median of 82 days. The vaccine had mainly mild adverse effects and was immunogenic in 99%, similar to the results in 18-to-25-year-olds. Vaccine efficacy during a delta-variant period was 88%.   May 26              Correspondence   Enterovirus D68 in Acute Flaccid Myelitis Motor Neurons  M.R. Vogt and Others        Autopsy material from a child who died from an acute flaccid myelitis–like illness showed EV-D68 RNA and protein in anterior horn cells and their axons, strongly implicating the virus as the cause of the disorder.

Fajgenbaum and Others        A 55-year-old man was evaluated for a mediastinal mass, which was identified during an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue. He had mediastinal lymphadenopathy with low FDG uptake, splenomegaly, anasarca, elevated inflammatory marker levels, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. What is the diagnosis?   May 26          Review Article   Brain Tumors in Children  A.R. Cohen        Childhood brain tumors were previously classified by histologic appearance and location. A new classification includes genetic changes, which have prognostic significance and may lead to therapeutic targets. This review focuses on pediatric gliomas, ependymomas, and medulloblastomas.   May 19          Perspective   E Pluribus Unum  I. Mulasi   A case that would otherwise have set off an avalanche of investigations and therapeutics, family meetings, and consultations was quietly referred for charity hospice care, though Ms. M.’s immigration status made acceptance even by a hospice agency precarious.   May 26                Review Article   Gliflozins in Cardiac and Renal Disease  E. Braunwald   Gliflozins — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors — lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin in patients with type 2 diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. The agents also improve cardiac function in patients who have heart failure with or without type 2 diabetes and improve renal function, with few adverse effects.

Knipe and Others        A 57-year-old man with polyarteritis nodosa was evaluated for cough and pulmonary opacities. Chest CT revealed multifocal clustered centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern. A galactomannan test was positive. What is the diagnosis?

Their latest video features Carlos Santana playing “Oye Como Va,” a song he made famous in 1970. He’s joined by Cindy Blackman, Tito Puente, Jr. (whose father wrote the song in 1963), bassist Tal Wilkenfeld, Rubén Rada and musicians from Colombia, Panama, Uruguay, the Congo, Brazil, and beyond. For more Playing for Change videos, see the Relateds below. The one featuring John Paul Jones  performing  “When The Levee Breaks” is a personal favorite.

Jazz was an international music, spreading across the Atlantic to London, Paris, and Berlin and across the Pacific to Shanghai, Manilla, and Tokyo. Luxury liners crossed the ocean and their house bands ferried new styles of dance music with them. “There was precious little improvisation,” in early Japanese jazz, “but that wasn’t as big a deal, as you know, in American jazz of the 1910s or ’20s,” historian E. Taylor Atkins tells NPR .  Japan even had its own jazz age. The word first entered the country in a 1929 “popular song attached to a movie called Tokyo March ,” says Atkins. “The lyrics refer to jazz, and … that’s sort of where it came into mass consciousness. It was associated with dance halls, it was associated with ‘modern girls’ and ‘modern boys’ — the Japanese version of flappers and dandies — and the urban leisure classes: excess, and dogs and cats sleeping together, and all those sorts of portents of future calamity.”      When calamity came in the form of World War II, jazz was banned in Japan as the music of the enemy. On August 15, 1945, when the Emperor went on the radio to announce Japan’s surrender, Hattori Ryoichi , “Japan’s premier jazz composer and arranger,” found himself stuck in Shanghai, “the city that since the late 1920s had served as the jazz Mecca of Asia,” Michael Bourdaghs writes in a history of Japanese pop music . “From now on,” Ryoichi supposedly toasted his fellow musicians upon hearing the news, “we can carry out our musical activities in freedom.”          How little Ryoichi could have predicted the kind of musical freedom Japanese jazz would find. But first there was a period of imitation. “In the early postwar years, Japanese musicians were essentially copying the Americans they admired,” notes Dean Van Nguyen at The Guardian . Some of the most popular bands on TV and film were comic acts like Frankie Sakai and the City Slickers , a big band formed in 1953 in imitation of Spike Jones & The City Slickers. Another popular jazz comedy act, Hajime Hana & The Crazy Cats “are significant,” writes Atkins, “for capitalizing and purveying an image of jazz musicians as clownish, slang-singing ne’er-do-wells.”          Pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi was “the first Japanese artist to break away from simply copying American artists and develop a distinctive sound and identity that incorporated Japanese harmonies and instruments,” Van Nguyen writes. By the later 60s and 70s, economic development led to a “renaissance” of Japanese jazz, writes the Sabukaru Guide to 1970’s Japanese Jazz . “The unique creative landscape in the jazz community, along with Japanese music as a whole becoming simultaneously more experimental and mainstream, led to an abundance of excellent Japanese jazz music in the 1970s.”  In the four playlists here, you can hear hours of this groundbreaking music from some of the greatest names you’ve probably never heard in Japanese jazz. These include trombonist Hiroshi Suzuki, “one of the most-revered Japanese jazz artists,” notes the blog Pink Wafer Club , “even if most listers are only familiar with his work thanks to the number of times his music has been sampled.” Suzuki’s 1975 album Cat is one of the funkiest jazz albums from any country released in the decade.          These playlists also include fusion keyboardist Mikio Masuda, saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, and other musicians who, like Akiyoshi, helped spur “young artists to evolve away from Blue Note mimicry towards free jazz, fusion funk, spiritual, modal and bebop,” writes Van Nguyen. “These daring virtuosos implanted rock and electronic elements, or took influences from Afrobeat and flamenco music.” Their international influences reflected 1970s jazz experiments around the globe. The music also benefitted from the excellent recording quality of Japanese studios and the rise of smaller labels, which allowed for more experimental artists to record and release albums.

Bach compositions on the rich, resonant Baroque lute. In Bach’s time, lutenists were some of the most widely-admired instrumental players, and it’s easy to see why. The Baroque lute is not an easy instrument to play. Much less so were the theorbo and chitarrone , instruments like it but with longer necks for longer bass strings. We see Mascardi concentrate with utmost intensity on every note, a virtuoso on an instrument that Bach himself could not master.  Indeed, there has been significant debate over whether Bach actually composed his four pieces for solo lute for that instrument and not another. For one thing, he seems to have had a “weak grasp” of the instrument, guitarist and lutenist Cameron O’Connor writes in an examination of the evidence.      “The lute may have been an intimidating subject even for Bach.” There are several problems with authenticating existing copies of the music, and “none of the pieces in staff notation is playable on the standard Baroque lute without some transposition of the basses and changes in chord positions.”          Classical guitarist Clive Titmuss notes , “as student guitarists, we learned that J.S. Bach wrote four suites and a number of miscellaneous pieces for the lute, now played on the guitar.” However, recent scholarship seems to show that Bach, that most revered of Baroque composers, “did not write any music specifically intended for solo lute.” As O’Connor speculates, it was “the Lautenwerck, or lute harpsichord… which Bach most likely had in mind while composing many of his ‘lute’ works.” You can see it in action here .  What does this debate add to our appreciation of Mascardi’s playing? Very little, perhaps. British lutenist and Bach scholar Nigel North writes in his Linn Records Bach on the Lute set, “Instead of labouring over perpetuating the idea that the so-called lute pieces of Bach are proper lute pieces I prefer to take the works for unaccompanied Violin or Cello and make them into new works for lute, keeping (as much as possible) to the original text, musical intention, phrasing and articulation, yet transforming them in a way particular to the lute so that they are satisfying to play and to hear.”  A lutenist with the skill of North or Mascardi can transform solo Bach pieces — whether originally written for violin, cello, or lautenwerck — into the idiom of their chosen instrument. In Mascardi’s transformations here, these works sound positively transporting.  Related Content:  How a Bach Canon Works. Brilliant.

But the book has enjoyed its greatest fame in the past decade, thanks in part to a 2017 adaptation on Hulu and a sequel, The Testaments , published two years thereafter. It’s even become prominent in mass culture, frequently referenced in discussions of real-life politics and society in the manner of Nineteen Eighty-Four or Fahrenheit 451 .  Like George Orwell and Ray Bradbury’s famous works, The Handmaid’s Tale also seems at risk of becoming less often read than publicly referenced — and therefore, no small amount of the time, publicly misinterpreted. The only way to fortify yourself against such abuse of literature is, of course, actually to read the book. Fortunately, The Handmaid’s Tale  is now widely available, unlike certain books in certain places that have been subject to bans. It is against such banning that the latest edition of Atwood’s novel stands, printed and bound using only fireproof materials.      “Across the United States and around the world, books are being challenged, banned, and even burned,” says publisher Penguin Random House. “So we created a special edition of a book that’s been challenged and banned for decades.” This uniquely “unburnable” Handmaid’s Tale “will be presented for auction by Sotheby’s New York from May 23 to June 7 with all proceeds going to benefit PEN America’s work in support of free expression .” You can bid on it at Sotheby’s site , where as of this writing the price stands at USD $70,000.  Penguin has experimented with physically metaphorical books before: the paperback edition of Nineteen Eighty-Four , for example, whose cover becomes less “censored” with use . More recently, the graphic design studio Super Terrain published Fahrenheit 451 , its title long a byword for book-burning,  that only becomes readable with the application of heat . But it’s Ballantine’s 1953 special edition of that novel , “bound in Johns-Manville quinterra, an asbestos material with exceptional resistance to pyrolysis,” that truly set the precedent for this one-off Handmaid ‘s tale. Those making bids certainly understand the book’s place in today’s cultural debates — but let’s hope they also intend to read it.

But then I remind myself that the video store itself is a thing of the past, and to see one so well stocked, Library of Alexandria style, is news itself. For the above video, the director browsing the DVDs is none other than madcap genius Terry Gilliam. The video store is Paris’ JM Video . The chat as expected is marvelous. (Only 20 minutes? I’m sure many of us could listen to Gilliam rabbit on about his favorite films for twice, thrice that.)  Along the way, here are some things we learn:   Some of his favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick, Lina Wertmuller, Federico Fellini, and one of his current friends, Albert Dupontel, the French actor-director who has used Gilliam in several of his films.  He is thanked in the credits of Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. Why? Because when Tarantino was at the Sundance Institute with his script, it was only Gilliam who immediately saw the brilliant screenplay for what it was, and encouraged Tarantino to stay true to himself.  He’s not a fan of Die Hard , but it was the scene where Bruce Willis talks to his wife while picking glass shards out of his foot that revealed a vulnerability in the actor. It led to Gilliam casting Bruce Willis in 12 Monkeys. Similarly, he was able to work with Brad Pitt and get him to flip his cool and handsome demeanor on its head for the manic co-starring role.  Gilliam stole the idea of multiple actors playing the same title character in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (after lead actor Heath Ledger died during shooting) from Luis Buñuel’s  That Obscure Object of Desire . In that film, two women play the same character interchangeably. If it’s good enough for Buñuel…  Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible (parts one and two) is a “dangerous” film, because it was one of Putin’s most watched movies. (Not that we should stop watching Eisenstein.) Gilliam’s way of pronouncing Putin as “poutine” is intentional, no?  Being a fan of Monty Python was a good way of getting cast in a Gilliam film. The director knows he would have not worked with Sean Connery (in Time Bandits) or Robert DeNiro (in Brazil) if both didn’t know his work on the classic comedy. (It also helps to have producers who go golfing with A-list actors.)  He disses Christopher Nolan (“technically brilliant” but then “the films become video games” with “no gravity”), and repeats a swipe against Spielberg’s Schindler’s List that he heard from Kubrick. (“It’s a film about success.”)  He imagines a better closing edit to Close Encounters that ends upon seeing the legs of the alien as the hatch opens. Then we would have had something to talk about on the way home, he says.   There’s another video in the series featuring David Cronenberg , along with visits from Michael Bay, Asghar Farhadi, Audrey Diwan, Dario Argento, and many more.

Though the state pledged €10 million, the budget of an ambitious renovation will surely come to many times that — but still, we may imagine, only a fraction of the money it took to build the Colosseum in the first place. In fact we have to imagine it, since we have no records of what that icon of Rome actually cost. In the video above , history Youtuber Garrett Ryan, creator of the channel Told in Stone , does so by not just marshaling all his knowledge of the ancient world but also crowdsourcing others’ knowledge of modern construction techniques and expenses.  First, Ryan must reckon the cost of the Colosseum in sestertii, the “big brass coins” common in Rome of the first century AD. “At the time the Colosseum was built,” he says, “one sestertius could buy two loaves of bread, four cups of cheap wine, or a single cup of good wine.”      The average unskilled laborer could expect to earn around four sestertii per day, and this project needed thousands of such laborers to excavate its foundation trench alone. Then came the laying of the foundation itself, followed by the building of the superstructure, which remains formidable even in the ruined state we know today. Its materials included 100,000 cubic meters of travertine — “roughly one-fiftieth, incidentally, of all travertine ever quarried by the Romans.”  A good deal of travertine also went into the Getty Center , perhaps the closest thing to a Colosseum-scale construction project in modern-day America. The Getty’s total cost came to $733 million, a price tag befitting the wealth synonymous with its name. But it still came cheaper than the Colosseum by Ryan’s estimate, or at least by most of the estimates at which he arrives. Consulting with several of his viewers experienced in architecture and construction, he calculates that building an exact replica of the Colosseum in today’s United States — taking into account the much greater efficiency of current tools, as well as the much greater cost of labor — roughly equivalent to $150,000,000 to more than $1 billion. That amount of money obviously exists in our world; whether we possess the necessary ambition is less clear. Then again, ancient Rome didn’t have Lego .

And yet that texture really does manifest everywhere in Korean life, most palpably on the streets of the capital. In my favorite neighborhoods, one passes through a variety of different eras walking down a single alley. “Third-wave” coffee shops and “newtro” bars coexist with family restaurants unchanged for decades and even small industrial workshops. Those workshops produce clothing, plumbing fixtures, printed matter, electronics, and much else besides, in many cases late into the night. For all its reputation as a high-tech “Asian Tiger,” this remains, clearly and presently, a country that makes things.          You can see just how Korea makes things on the Youtube channel All Process of World , which has drawn tens of millions of views with its videos of factories: factories making forks , bricks , sliced tuna , sheepskin jackets , bowling balls , humanoid robots . The scale of these Korean industrial operations ranges from the massive to the artisanal; some products are unique to twenty-first century life, and others have been in use for centuries.      On the traditional side, All Process of World has provided close-up views of the making of ceramic teapots , wooden window frames (as you would see in a classical Korean hanok ), handheld percussive moktak to aid Buddhist monks in their chants, and even jeogori , the distinctive jackets worn with hanbok dresses.          Judging by the comments, All Process of World’s many viewers hail from around the globe. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, given Korea’s newfound worldwide popularity. But that so-called “Korean wave” owes less to the appeal of Korea’s traditional culture than its modern one, less to its rustic yet elegant pottery and brilliantly colorful formalwear than to BTS and “Gangnam Style,” Parasite  and Squid Game — whose “robot girl” appears on a rug made in one All Process of World video . Another shows us the production of an equally modern item, the face masks seen everywhere in Korea during the past two years. Just a few weeks ago, the government gave us the okay to take those masks off outdoors. While hoping for the arrival of fully post-COVID era, we’d do well to keep in mind how the past always seems to find its way into the present.

Modern craftspeople can recover or reasonably approximate old techniques and materials, and produce artifacts that can be passed off as authentic by the unscrupulous. The spirit of the thing, however, can never be recovered. Try as they might, scholars and conservators will never be able to enter the mind of a Medieval scribe or manuscript illuminator. Their social world has disappeared into a distant mist; we can only dimly guess at what their lives were like.   Thus, for many years, the reception of Hieronymus Bosch — the bizarre fantasist from the Netherlands whose visions of Earth, Heaven, and Hell have amused and terrified viewers — stressed the proto-Surrealism of his work , assuming he must have had other intentions than proselytizing.      Most recent interpretation, however, has pulled in the other direction , stressing the degree to which Bosch and his contemporaries believed in a universe that was exactly as weird as he depicted it, no exaggeration necessary; emphasizing how Bosch felt an urgent need to spare viewers of his work from the fates he showed in his art.   What passed through the mind of the illuminator of the manuscript shown here, the Augsburg  Book of Miraculous Signs ? We can never know. At best, scholars have settled on a name — artist and printmaker Hans Burgkmair the Younger — though little is known about him And we have a date, 1552, when this “curious and lavishly illustrated manuscript appeared in the Swabian Imperial Free city of Augsburg, then a part of the Holy Roman Empire, located in present-day Germany,” Maria Popova writes at the Marginalian . In the video at the top from Hochelaga, you can learn more about the “bizarre text” and the “meaning behind its unique contents” and “scenes of calamity and chaos.”   The strange book presents “in remarkable detail and wildly imaginative artwork, Medieval Europe’s growing obsessions with signs sent from ‘God,'” Popova writes, “a testament to the basic human propensity for magical thinking.” More specifically, The Book of Miracles  recounts a host of Biblical signs and wonders in chronological order: from the first book of the Old Testament to the spectacular end of the New. In-between are “hallucinatory accounts of classical and contemporary celestial phenomena,” Tim Smith-Laing writes at Apollo . “The manuscript comprises nothing less than a picture chronicle of the world’s past, present and future, in 192 miracles.”   While Protestant Christianity condemned Medieval magic, “the recurrence of miracles in the Bible meant that the Protestant reformers of the sixteenth century could not reject such wonders as superstitions in the way they scorned Catholic beliefs,” Marina Warner writes at The New York Review of Books . German reformers were on high alert for the miraculous and ominous: “The sixteenth-century Zwinglian clergyman Johann Jakob Wick filled twenty-four albums with reports of such wonders in broadsheets and pamphlets,” seeing signs in the birth of a two-headed calf or “an unfortunate, flipper-handed infant.”   All of which is to say that we have little reason to doubt that the creator of The Book of Miracles meant the work as an earnest warning to its readers, although its wondrous images might look to us like proto-fantasy or sci-fi illustration. The book illustrates 1533 reports of flying dragons in Bohemia, an event, notes The Guardian , that “went on for several days, with over four hundred of them, both big and small, flying together.” It shows a comet appearing in 1506, one that stayed for several days and nights “and turned its tail towards Spain.” Thereby followed “a lot of fruit,” which was then “completely destroyed by caterpillars or rats,” then a violent earthquake in Constantinople.   The very tenuous connection between disparate natural phenomena, the hearsay reports of magical happenings, you can read about all of these signs and wonders in a republished version by Taschen , in English, French, and German. It is, Popova writes, “a singular shrine to some of the most eternal of human hopes and fears, and, above all, our immutable longing for grace, for mercy, for the miraculous.” See more images from The Book of Miracles at The Guardian .

The over 900 restorations that he’s helped fund through the Film Foundation non-profit have been the subject of Criterion Collection box sets , special anniversary screenings and festival showings, and now a special monthly online screening room will give viewers a chance to see some familiar and not-so-familiar films that have been saved from destruction.  According to the welcome message at the Restoration Screening Room , “Presentations will take place within a 24-hour window on the second Monday of each month, along with Special Features about the films and their restoration process. Monthly programming will encompass a broad array of restorations, including classic and independent films, documentaries, and silent films from around the world.’”      As of this writing, the window has closed for its inaugural film, Powell and Pressburger’s 1945 I Know Where I’m Going! but you can still click through to see the extras that come with the film: an Introduction by Scorsese; an interview with Scorsese’s long-time editor Thelma Schoonmaker (who was also Powell’s spouse for six years until 1990 and who worked on the restoration); Kent Jones interviewing Kevin Macdonald, the grandson of Pressburger and his biographer; the Film Foundation’s Margaret Bodde interviewing Tilda Swinton, a huge fan of the film; directors Joanna Hogg and Scorsese talking about the film; a before and after look at the restoration; an image gallery; and finally a links page called “explore” that is quite overwhelming in its thoroughness .  The 4K restoration’s next stop is the Criterion Channel , so if you subscribe to that paid service, find it there. But the Film Foundation’s premieres are completely free and feature a live chat on the screening night.  In the coming months look forward to Fellini’s La Strada (June 13), Govindan Aravindan’s Kummatty (July 11), a double feature of The Chase (d. Arthur Ripley) and Detour (d. Edgar G.

During most of Munch’s life, “European cities were going through truly exceptional changes. Industrialization and economic shifts brought fear, obsessions, diseases, political unrest, and radicalism. Questions were being raised about society, and the changing role of man within it: about our psyche, our social responsibilities, and most radical of all, about the existence of God.” It was hardly the most suitable time or place for the mentally troubled, but then, Munch seems to have possessed more psychological fortitude than he let the public know. A savvy self-promoter, he understood the value of living like someone whose terrible perceptions keep him on the brink of total breakdown.      But then, Munch never did have it easy. “His mother and his sister both died of tuberculosis. His father and grandfather suffered from depression, and another sister, Laura, from pneumonia. His only brother would later die of pneumonia.” He found solace in art, a pursuit strongly opposed by his religious father, and eventually joined the bohemian world , a milieu that encouraged him to let his inner world shape his aesthetic. Drawing inspiration from the French Impressionists and the drama of August Strindberg, Munch eventually found his way to starting a cycle of paintings called The Frieze of Life .  It was during his work on The Frieze of Life that, according to a diary entry of January 22nd, 1892, Munch found himself walking along a fjord. “I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord — the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked.” The fjord was on the way back from the asylum to which his beloved younger sister had recently been confined; Payne imagines that her “screams of terror must have haunted him as he walked away.” From these grim origins, The Scream emerged to become an oft-referenced and highly relatable image — even to those who see in it nothing more than their own frustration at receiving too much e-mail.

You delivered a quality product at a fair price, and you were extremely responsive to this customer’s difficult scheduling and logistics. In my opinion, it is IMPOSSIBLE for big suppliers or franchisers to match the quality of service that I got from your great family owned business. Thank you.”    M. Reynolds, Palo Alto    What Clients are Saying  “What a great experience.  From showroom, through installation these guys are the tops.  We had custom cabinets made for our living room and master bedroom, and also a custom fireplace mantle.  When on site our designer noticed the ornate trim detail of the window casing.  He sketched it onto his notes and it was incorporated into the final design.  On install day we had a power outage.  The installers did all the trim detail finishing, including several compound miter cuts by hand.  You don’t find this level of craftsmanship very often anymore!”    Brad G. Santa Clara, CA    What Clients are Saying  “Excellent customer service provided by Brandon!  He did a great job installing our closet organization systems!  Friendly and cleaned up well after each work day!  Will definitely consider them for our other needs!”    Ernest T. Newark, CA    What Clients are Saying  “This has been my second experience with Segale Bros. The first was perhaps ten years ago. The second was this past three months. Each time they have refaced kitchen cabinets in a rental property. Each time they have done an outstanding job at a fraction of the cost of new cabinets. I found the people easy to deal with, responsive and responsible. The organization and implementation of plans was first rate. The company aims for customer satisfaction–there was a chip out of a pull out breadboard which was not their doing, but they worked out a way to make it right.  Additionally, they accommodated my tenants’ need for a delay in installation due to recovery from surgery. It all worked smoothly. I recommend this company with no hesitation.”    Joan V. Kihei, HI    What Clients are Saying  “Many thanks for your outstanding work on our new kitchen and bar area cabinets.  As my interior designer said, “the cabinets look awesome.”  We now have the dream kitchen we always wanted. The support of your team thru design and installation exceed my expectations.  I greatly appreciated the Segale cabinet installer who has a sense of great pride in owing the quality of the installation and finishes. Many thanks!”    John Martin, CA    Next        Our Facility  Tour of Our Facility  At this time Segale Bros. was able to expand our operations to a more fitting 42K square foot facility.

With decades of experience building high-profile projects in the Golden State, our founding team set out to create a new kind of construction company, one built on long-term relationships, transparent business practices and an adaptive company culture. That vision and its values have given rise to one of the fastest-growing, most-respected builders in the western United States.

Careers  Begin or continue your construction career with Level 10 and build challenging projects, quickly advance your career, and receive highly-competitive benefits.             Core Markets  We build in eight diverse markets. Our people understand the unique requirements of each sector.             In the end, our building [Facebook MPK 20] finished ahead of schedule and under budget... It ended up costing us much less than any other major developments planned in Silicon Valley and taking way less time to build. - from Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook wall  Mark Zuckerberg, President, Facebook   View Project    It took an immense amount of planning to ensure that the clean rooms [on the CS Bio Headquarters Renovation & Expansion project] would be unaffected by construction, but Level 10 planned the project with great skill and precision. The project ran like clockwork. In fact, it ran better than clockwork.  Jason Chang, Chief Operating Officer, CS Bio Co.   View Project    Level 10's 181 Fremont team continually coordinates very well with the Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA) and the Salesforce Tower construction team to make sure our project, neighbors, businesses and surrounding job sites are not adversely affected by their activities. The team's exemplary communication is a great example of how to build in a highly dense and busy neighborhood.  Ron Alameida, Co-Director, Transbay Joint Powers Authority   View Project    Every large project is a series of problems in search of solutions. The team at Level 10 knows how to categorize, prioritize and analyze problems. They encourage and expect creative options from the team. They get decision makers in the room, drive towards a solution and clearly communicate a single path forward. The 181 Fremont team just got it done, over and over again.

Absolutely not. The migration process doesn’t affect your current shopping cart in any way. It will be up and running as usual while the data is being transferred.     How much does the service cost?   The Cart2Cart pricing is flexible. The migration cost depends on:  source platform type (the one you migrate from )  target platform type (the one you migrate to )  number of items to move (products, customers, orders)  You can calculate the exact price of your migration via the Migration Estimator        Can I try Cart2Cart for free?   Yes, we provide a free unlimited Demo Migration feature (test transfer). It allows moving a limited number of data entities (up to 10 products and customers/orders related to them) to your new platform in around 10-15 minutes. When you are satisfied with the Demo results, you can move on with the Full (paid) migration.     Do I risk losing data from my existing store during the migration?   The migration process is totally safe for the store that is migrated, and there is no risk of losing data. In layman's terms, the store database (products, customers, orders, etc.) is simply copied and pasted into your Target store. You can keep selling while your Source platform records are being moved to the new ecommerce platform.
